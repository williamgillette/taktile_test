# taktile_test

We’ve created a solution that automatically updates the code in your decision flows whenever you change underlying files in your GitHub repository. It works with two files you provided: Multiply.py and Summarize.py (please note that I did make a small change to the Multiply file). Here's how it works:

Listing All Decision Flows: The program asks Taktile to list all the decision flows (these are like workflows that guide decisions) available in your workspace. This helps us identify which flow needs to be updated.

Retrieving Details of the Flow: The program pulls up details about the different nodes in that flow.

Patching the Code: The program looks at the updated code in the Multiply.py and Summarize.py files. If changes have been made, the program automatically updates the code in the corresponding nodes in Taktile, so your decision flow stays up-to-date.

How It Works:
Every time you merge changes into the main branch of your GitHub repository, the automation script kicks in and does the following:

It checks which decision flow needs updating.
It identifies the nodes related to the Multiply.py and Summarize.py files.
It updates the code in those nodes based on the latest version of your Python files.

What You Need to Do:
All you need to do is merge the updated versions of Multiply.py and Summarize.py to your GitHub repository’s main branch. The automation will take care of the rest.
